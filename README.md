# Five card draw poker
This project was created to get used to Kotlin's syntax and kotlins lambda functions.
It's a five card draw poker game against no-one (not even AI) and has no betting.. so it's endless fun!

There is also some tests to make sure computer isn't cheating on you when checking your result.
And there should also be valid deck to play with.
